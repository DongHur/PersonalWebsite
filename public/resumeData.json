    "bio":"Currently I am a Harvard Undergrad pursuing my study in computational neuroscience to better understand how the human brain learns and function the way it does. My hobby is working on cool project (find out more in my portfolio). I also have a strong passion for education and providing both equity and excellence for all students. It brings me great joy to see people that I teach understand difficult concepts or find excitement in what they learn. Furthermore, I enjoy taking picture going out on a long excursion and taking picture of what the world has to offer (portfolio down below). Lastly, I enjoy compiling great quotes from online, movies, and books that I have read, which I post at the bottom of the page. Feel free to visit often to see new quotes that I found interesting.",
