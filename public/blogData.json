However, what if I told you that the fundamental courses are not the only thing in your kids&rsquo; school? What if I told you that your kids are taught to be followers and not leaders every day they step foot into their school? What if I told you your kids&rsquo; opinions and creativities are restricted in their school? What if I told you your kids have a higher probability of being demotivated to learn and become less than who they can be? What if I told you your financial status determines how well your kid is taught?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many hidden messages taught in schools that go unrecognized and have a large influence in how the kids think. Some hidden curriculum may be how the teacher teaches kid, how much of the student&rsquo;s opinion are respected, and what are expected of these children. Unsurprisingly, many of these hidden curriculums depend on the SES of that school, where higher expectation and respect are seen in higher SES schools. All of this ultimately lead students&rsquo; in lower SES school to continue to follow and restrict themselves in who they can become. On the other end, students&rsquo; in higher SES schools are reinforced to be future leaders and exceed in any problem they face. Ultimately, this leads to more disparities in SES with every passing generation.</p><p>&nbsp;This is my story of the &ldquo;hidden curriculum&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to a Magnet school called Science and Engineering Magnet High School (SEM). This school consisted of primarily Hispanics and Black who were in the lower socioeconomic status. From the name of my high school, it is not rocket science to see that all the students loved math and science and were good at them. This was especially true since there were only 100 kids in each grade that tested their way in to get a better education in these fields. From this it is obvious that the materials taught from my school was different from that of a normal public school. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg. Looking back, I realized there were many more &ldquo;hidden curriculum&rdquo; that differed from a normal public school.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some hidden curriculum consists of encouraging students to form solutions for themselves. Although some think that this is a given, many low tier schools do not reinforce this mindset. In fact, some schools force kids to solve solutions only their way without any inputs as to what the kids think. From my experience, I think it is critical to have students early on come up with solutions for themselves because many of future problems do not have a fixed method. As a result, restricting creativities and enforcing a certain methodological approach to a problem keeps kids in leash from becoming more than what they can be. It restricts the kids to think only in a certain way and to listen rather than lead.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another hidden curriculum is in the name of my school itself, Science and Engineering Magnet High School. Although we were not enforced to go into this field, we were constantly and unknowingly told that &ldquo;science and math was the right field for you&rdquo;. This was beneficial for our school since many students were motivated to strive higher in these fields. However, this is not the case in all the schools. In fact, I am lucky to attend a lower SES school that taught this hidden curriculum. Many students that attend a lower SES school are never told to achieve higher educations or challenge themselves in a difficult field.</p><p style='text-indent: .5in;'>Why? Do teachers from lower SES school lose hope in their children? Are students from higher SES smarter and more prepared for the real world? How do we change this? Why isn&rsquo;t the government doing anything about it?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because providing equity and excellence for lower SES is easier said than done. In real life, many plans do not have the expected outcome. In fact, studies show that putting more money in these lower SES school do not affect the students&rsquo; achievement. This goes to show that the issue is bigger than what money can solve. The issue is not only physical opportunity but also student mentality.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, next time you see a school, observe closely how the teacher interacts with kids and how the environment of the classroom is set. You may be surprised to see that there are many &ldquo;hidden curriculum&rdquo; that have deep impact on students&rsquo; perception and overall life.</p> "
